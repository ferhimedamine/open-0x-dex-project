# open-0x-dex-project
<B>Get your token listed and/or your DEX running with a minimal effort!<B>

0xchange.org is an abbreviation of "0xBitcoin Exchange on 0x Protocol," an open community project.

0xchange.org is a no-fee 0x relayer and white-label DEX platform that brings your crypto project live and plugs it into a reasonable market with minimal effort.

Your options vary from just getting your token listed to running a full-fledged exchange with your own branding.

<B>Always: 0% fees or middle man.</B>

Before you go any further, think about your goals.

If your goal is to get your token and project out in the market and noticed, this project may be an option for you.

If you your goal is to create your own DEX - with or without your own tokens - and plug into broader market, this project is a good option for you.

However, if your main intention is to <B>run an 0x relay and backend</B> yourself, and possibly generate some revenue by doing so, visit https://github.com/0xProject/0x-launch-kit-backend. By building your own relayer and setting fees you can generate some income. Flipsides of that option are: 1) you must set up a 0x relayer, 2) you must operate ("day-to-day") and 3) maintain ("upgrades") a 0x relayer, 4) you must create your own markets to 5) get traffic and 6) volume to your site. Remember that there are 1000's of dead-or-nearly-dead DEXes already out there, and creating your clientele is harder than you think.

Consolidating volume using <B>0x Mesh</B> https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh is a good option, but that is still at development stage and requires a lot of technical work that may not yield any substantial benefits, especially compared to other options. When it is ready for production, we will provide 0x Mesh with our service as well.

Now the options:

<H3>Option 1: Get Your Token Listed in 0xchange.org</H3>

Contact us in https://discord.gg/t2ca2DY and get your token listed in http://0xchange.org.

*** NOT AVAILABLE AS AN OPTION TODAY - PLEASE WAIT ***

<H3>Option 2: Plug-and-Play DEX with Minimum Branding</H3>

Requires Option 1 as a starting point.

Install a simple menu bar and frame on your webserver and point it to your default trading pair, and you have a fully functional DEX with your branding - just like that!

Instructions:
- TBD

Example: http:// [blocktime.exchange]

<H3>Option 3: Full DEX with Your Own Branding and Edits</H3>

Does not require Option 1.

Follow https://github.com/0xProject/0x-launch-kit-frontend

Use this as your backend source:

REACT_APP_RELAYER_URL='http://138.197.135.82:3001/v2/' yarn start

-> More instructions coming!

All options above are comparable to ForkDelta and Enclaves that both plug into EthereDelta contract. (That is a technologically challenged option but feel free to explore in https://github.com/forkdelta/.)
