# open-0x-dex-project
<B>Get your token listed and/or your DEX running with minimal effort!<B>

0xchange.org is an abbreviation of "0xBitcoin Exchange on 0x Protocol," an open community project.

0xchange.org is a no-fee 0x relayer and white-label DEX platform that brings your crypto project live and plugs it into a reasonable market with minimal effort.

Your options vary from just getting your token listed to running a DEX with your own branding. Always: 0% fees or middlemen.

There are several levels of ease and result you can choose. Before you go any further, think about your goals.

If your goal is to get your token and project out in the market and noticed, this project may be a relevant option for you.

If you your goal is to create your own DEX - with or without your own tokens - and plug into broader market, this project is a good option for you.

If your main intention is to <B>run an 0x relay and backend</B> yourself, and possibly generate some revenue by doing that, visit https://github.com/0xProject/0x-launch-kit-backend. By building your own relayer and setting fees (in ZRX) you can generate some income. Flipsides: 1) you must set up a 0x relayer, 2) you must operate (day-to-day) and 3) maintain (upgrades) 0x relayer, 4) you must create your own markets to get traffic to your site. Remember that there are 1000's of nearly-dead DEXes already out there, and creating your clientele and securing a interesting volume is harder than you think.

Consolidating volume using <B>0x Mesh</B> https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh is a good option, but that is still at development stage and requires a lot of technical work that may not yield any substantial benefits, especially compared to other options.
